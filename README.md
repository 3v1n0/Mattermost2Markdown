# Mattermost2Markdown
With this simple script it's possible to export direct and group message channels (chats) from Mattermost to single Markdown files.
The attachments will be downloaded as well.

> [!NOTE]  
> This program only works with channels in which your account is a member.
> It may work if your account has admin privileges, but I haven't tried that.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Mattermost server with enabled API and user account

## Usage
### Session Token
First you need to get your personal session token.

```commandline
curl -i -d '{"login_id":"someone@nowhere.com","password":"thisisabadpassword","token":"mfa-token"}' https://urltoyourmattermostserver.com/api/v4
```

For further information look at the [Mattermost API Reference (4.0.0)](https://api.mattermost.com/#tag/authentication).

If enabled you can also generate a new session token for applications in the user settings.

### Channel ID
Then you may want to find out the IDs of the channels you want to export.

1. Select the channel from the left sidebar.
2. Select the channel name at the top.
3. Select View Info.
4. Copy the ID of the channel from the right sidebar.

### Export
Now you have everything to begin with the export.

1. Download this program [Mattermost2Markdown.py](https://github.com/simon-eller/Mattermost2Markdown/blob/main/Mattermost2Markdown.py) to your machine with Python installed.
2. Insert the server and user data.
3. Run the program.
   - Now for every ID in the `channels` list a subfolder named like the user will be created.
   - The attachments will be stored in this folder.
   - Every message will be saved to the file `chat.md` also stored in this folder.

Now you can view your exported file in a Markdown editor.

## Advanced
### Timezone and Time Format
The program converts the timestamps of messages to the timezone configured for the user.
